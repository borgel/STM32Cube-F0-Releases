@par Description

This firmware is a basic example on how to use the STMTouch driver with 1 linear
sensor. The ECS and DTO are also used.

Observed behaviour:

- The LED4 is ON each time the linear is touched.
- The LED5 blinks frequency follow the linear sensor position when touched.
- The LED3 blinks continuously in case of error.

- The ECS is ON when no touch is detected (all sensors are in the RELEASE state).
  The ECS is always present but its behavior can be modified using some parameters in
  the tsl_conf.h file.

- You can experiment the DTO by touching a sensor for few seconds. The RELEASE state
  is automatically entered and a re-calibration is performed after the timeout is reached.
  This timeout is programmable by the TSLPRM_DTO parameter in the tsl_conf.h file.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072RB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F072B-Discovery RevC board. It can be
    easily tailored to any other devices that embed the TSC peripheral and to
    any other development board supporting touchsensing sensor.
     
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
