@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and TIM2 to convert continuously data 
from ADC channel. Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new 
conversion is started by ADC.

Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new conversion is started by ADC1.

At the end of conversion, an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
ADC1 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
conversion complete call back function (HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback).
The converted values can be monitored by adding "uhADCxConvertedValue" to the debugger.

The timer is used to trigger an ADC measure at 20 KHz.

Configuration of the timer to trig an ADC measure at 20 Khz:
  From the reference manual, Reset and Clock control part, Timer 2 is clocked on PCLK1.
  The function SystemClock_Config() configures the clock divider as follows:
  1) The system clock is 48 MHz.
  2) AHB  Prescaler = 1 => AHB clock is 48 MHz.
  So, in TIM_Config function, we set the following period: htim.Init.Period = 2400;

The voltage on pin PC.00 (ADC_CHANNEL_10)can vary using an external power supply.

Remark: LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.
