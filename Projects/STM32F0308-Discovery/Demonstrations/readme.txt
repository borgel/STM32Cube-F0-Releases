@par Demonstration Description 

This demonstration consists on using the USER push button B1 connected to PA0 and 
the two leds LED4 and LED3 connected respectively to PC8 and PC9.

In the demonstration  the LED3 is initially blinking each 200ms.
  - For the first pressing on the USER button, the speed of the led blinking is incremented. 
    The LED3 blinks each 100ms.
  - For the second pressing on the USER button, LED3 stops blinking and the status is off.
  - A third pressing on the USER button causes the initial behavior of the LED3.

Each time the USER button is pressed, the LED4 is turned on for 1s.
